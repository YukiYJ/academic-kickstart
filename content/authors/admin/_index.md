Hello! I'm a final-year undergraduate at [Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk). My research interests include Text Mining and Machine Learning. Now I am conducting my capstone project, "Performance Evaluation using Artificial Intelligence", supervised by [Dr. Yan Liu](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/staffs/detail/1295).
